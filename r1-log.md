# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - zeebear

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Monday 27 April 2020.

## Log

### R1D1 (27-04-2020)

Re-starting [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), with the intention of building confidence in Ruby & Ruby on Rails. Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge and joined the Discord group. Will also tweet progress daily. Cloned this 100DaysOfCode fork to my computer.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) has tweaked their curriculum since I last did anything there, so I'm filling in the gaps where they've added stuff in sections I had finished. Today, finished [Command Line Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101) and [Setting Up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/setting-up-git). Starting the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage).

### R1D2 (28-04-2020)

Continued the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Reaquainting myself with HTML, CSS and Sublime Text. Slow going, but hopefully will build momentum.

### R1D3 (29-04-2020)

Still going with the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Managed to center the logo and the search box, now I have to figure out how to style the form and position the search buttons. Incredibly slow going!

### R1D4 (30-04-2020)

Almost finished with the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Positioned the buttons, am happy with the layout, started styling the form. Tomorrow I will finish styling the form. Need to decide if I want to add the magnifying glass and microphone icons to the search box -- that would be a lot more coding.

### R1D5 (02-05-2020)

One button left to style (sign in button), and then I have to make the page responsive. Maybe I'll really finish the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) tomorrow? Ha ha ha…

### R1D6 (03-05-2020)

Finished the [Google homepage clone](https://zeebear.github.io/google-homepage/) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) enough to submit it to the forum and ask for feedback :sweat_smile: I'm actually pretty pleased at how it turned out -- and it only took me 2 poms to finish!

### R1D7 (04-05-2020)

I'm doing everything backwards, as usual! I had started TOP goodness knows how long ago (the forum was on Gitter in those days, for reference :) ) and had gotten partially through the Web Dev 101 section. When I started again 7 days ago I just went down the list, finishing the unchecked things. After finishing the Google homepage clone yesterday I had a look at some of the things that I had "done", and realised that I had done all of fCC's Responsive Web Design until the tribute page assignment, and had then stopped. I decided that I should stop whining about hating CSS, give up on JS for now, and instead keep the momentum going and finish the fCC Responsive Web Design cert, since I'm so close and it's good practice…

I logged into CodePen for the first time in ages, and to my enormous surprise discovered that at some point I had started the Survey Form assignment -- all of the html was there, and some rudimentary styling. With what I had learned from the Google homepage clone I whipped it into shape in one afternoon :satisfied: Guess there's something to be said for practice and momentum!

**May the fourth be with you!**
