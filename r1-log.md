# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - zeebear

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Monday 27 April 2020.

## Log

### R1D1 (27-04-2020)

Re-starting [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), with the intention of building confidence in Ruby & Ruby on Rails. Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge and joined the Discord group. Will also tweet progress daily. Cloned this 100DaysOfCode fork to my computer.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) has tweaked their curriculum since I last did anything there, so I'm filling in the gaps where they've added stuff in sections I had finished. Today, finished [Command Line Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101) and [Setting Up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/setting-up-git). Starting the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage).

### R1D2 (28-04-2020)

Continued the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Reaquainting myself with HTML, CSS and Sublime Text. Slow going, but hopefully will build momentum.

### R1D3 (29-04-2020)

Still going with the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Managed to center the logo and the search box, now I have to figure out how to style the form and position the search buttons. Incredibly slow going!

### R1D4 (30-04-2020)

Almost finished with the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Positioned the buttons, am happy with the layout, started styling the form. Tomorrow I will finish styling the form. Need to decide if I want to add the magnifying glass and microphone icons to the search box -- that would be a lot more coding.

### R1D5 (02-05-2020)

One button left to style (sign in button), and then I have to make the page responsive. Maybe I'll really finish the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) tomorrow? Ha ha ha…

### R1D6 (03-05-2020)

Finished the [Google homepage clone](https://zeebear.github.io/google-homepage/) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) enough to submit it to the forum and ask for feedback :sweat_smile: I'm actually pretty pleased at how it turned out -- and it only took me 2 poms to finish!

### R1D7 (04-05-2020)

I'm doing everything backwards, as usual! I had started TOP goodness knows how long ago (the forum was on Gitter in those days, for reference :) ) and had gotten partially through the Web Dev 101 section. When I started again 7 days ago I just went down the list, finishing the unchecked things. After finishing the Google homepage clone yesterday I had a look at some of the things that I had "done", and realised that I had done all of fCC's Responsive Web Design until the tribute page assignment, and had then stopped. I decided that I should stop whining about hating CSS, give up on JS for now, and instead keep the momentum going and finish the fCC Responsive Web Design cert, since I'm so close and it's good practice…

I logged into CodePen for the first time in ages, and to my enormous surprise discovered that at some point I had started the Survey Form assignment -- all of the html was there, and some rudimentary styling. With what I had learned from the Google homepage clone I whipped it into shape in one afternoon :satisfied: Guess there's something to be said for practice and momentum!

**May the fourth be with you!**

### R1D8 (05-05-2020)

I only had an hour today. Did the html skeleton for the fCC product landing page.

### R1D9 (06-05-2020)

I only had an hour today. Got bogged down with email verification and form submission, spent most of the time playing with regexes. I think the issue is fixed. Tomorrow on to content!

### R1D10 (07-05-2020)

Sourced images and began to make a story for the fCC product landing page, then realised that I was doing a "shop" instead of a "product landing page" and had to start over. Finished writing all the text, sourced all the images, uploaded them to Cloudinary, and the html is basically finished and ready for CSS tomorrow.

### R1D11 (08-05-2020)

Had fun finding cheesy fonts that I wouldn't usually use. The [fCC product landing page](https://zeebear.github.io/product_landing_page/) is live on GitHub! It works fine on a computer, and is already surprisingly responsive. Tomorrow I have to start with the media queries and make the navbar and videos work on mobiles, oh joy…

### R1D12 (09-05-2020)

Submitted the [fCC product landing page](https://zeebear.github.io/product_landing_page/) and fixed the two errors so that it passed, but I'm going to have to rework the CSS to make it work on mobiles before it's fit to be put on my portfolio page

### R1D13 (12-05-2020)

Tried various ways and methods to make the embedded Vimeo videos be even a little responsive and play nicely with the smaller-screen version of my site. Nothing worked for me. In a fit of pique I decided to just leave the videos for larger-screen and remove them altogether for smaller-screen. Will try making everything else look better tomorrow.

### R1D14 (13-05-2020)

Made a new style.css and made the mobile site work first. I have three more things left to do, and everything else seems to be working as I would like. Left to do:
+ Hamburger menu in mobile view
+ Attempt to put videos back in mobile view
+ Choose body text colour (easier to see it in the daylight)

### R1D15 (14-05-2020)

Spent all my time trying to make a menu for the mobile version, and not managing. I'm not sure if what I want to do is actually possible with CSS. Set everything back to how it was yesterday. Will try again tomorrow.

### R1D16 (15-05-2020)

Took a while, but I managed to make the menu work like I wanted it to. I also put the videos back into the mobile view, set the social media header tags, and made a favicon. All the Lighthouse audit tests on Chrome are green. After yesterday's impasse, that feels pretty good.
Left to do tomorrow:
+ I've chosen the body text color, now to stick it in
+ Swop the header and the video
+ Fix the wonky exploded cauldron picture
+ Think again about how to close the mobile menu bar (it's a toggle, I'm not sure if it will be possible to do it "automatically"…)
+ Make all the "highlights" photos the same size
+ Make the first video auto-play

### R1D17 (16-05-2020)

Tried to come up with a way to close the mobile menu when a link is clicked, but couldn't come up with anything that would work with CSS only. I tried several ways to make the video auto-play. It now works on Firefox but not on Chrome on the desktop, but it works on many mobile browsers. Everything else is done, so I'm going to move on to the next project tomorrow.

### R1D18 (17-05-2020)

Decided to use the text of [Learn X in Y minutes' excellent Ruby overview](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/) for my technical page. It'll be a good way for me to review, and since I've fully credited them I hope they won't mind! Started the HTML skeleton today, following the user stories given. Already learned something new from the 5 sections I've done already -- bitwise operations!

### R1D19 (18-05-2020)

Started styling the mobile version today. Menu went much quicker than on the last site!

### R1D20 (04-06-2020)

Back in the saddle after a fortnight's break due to crippling sinus infection. Finished making the mobile menu work -- [this article about position: sticky in CSS](https://medium.com/@elad/css-position-sticky-how-it-really-works-54cd01dc2d46) was a lifesaver, as was realising that I have to set display to something other than static in order to set a z-index value. Then on to the desktop version, where the navbar is done and the main body is underway.

### R1D21 (05-06-2020)
