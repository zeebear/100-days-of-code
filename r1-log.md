## Log

### R1D1 

Re-starting [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), with the intention of building confidence in Ruby & Ruby on Rails. Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge and joined the Discord group. Will also tweet progress daily. Cloned this 100DaysOfCode fork to my computer.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) has tweaked their curriculum since I last did anything there, so I'm filling in the gaps where they've added stuff in sections I had finished. Today, finished [Command Line Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101) and [Setting Up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/setting-up-git). Starting the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage).
