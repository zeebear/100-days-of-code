The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Monday 27 April 2020.

## Log

### R1D1 (27-04-2020)

Re-starting [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), with the intention of building confidence in Ruby & Ruby on Rails. Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge and joined the Discord group. Will also tweet progress daily. Cloned this 100DaysOfCode fork to my computer.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) has tweaked their curriculum since I last did anything there, so I'm filling in the gaps where they've added stuff in sections I had finished. Today, finished [Command Line Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101) and [Setting Up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/setting-up-git). Starting the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage).

### R1D2 (28-04-2020)

Continued the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Reaquainting myself with HTML, CSS and Sublime Text. Slow going, but hopefully will build momentum.

### R1D3 (29-04-2020)

Still going with the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Managed to center the logo and the search box, now I have to figure out how to style the form and position the search buttons. Incredibly slow going!

### R1D4 (30-04-2020)

Almost finished with the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Positioned the buttons, am happy with the layout, started styling the form. Tomorrow I will finish styling the form. Need to decide if I want to add the magnifying glass and microphone icons to the search box -- that would be a lot more coding.

### R1D5 (02-05-2020)

One button left to style (sign in button), and then I have to make the page responsive. Maybe I'll really finish the [Google homepage clone](https://github.com/zeebear/google-homepage) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) tomorrow? Ha ha haâ€¦
